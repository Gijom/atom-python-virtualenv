## Description

Python virtualenv support for Atom

## Disclaimer

Part of this code comes from the first virtual env support for Atom/Python (https://github.com/jhutchins/virtualenv), but I have created a new repository with a new name, as this project is no longer being maintained and the changes made are substantial.
