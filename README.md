## Intro

The goal of this package is to provide management tools related to Python
virtual environments. This package currently supports two types of setups.

1. A [virtualenvwrapper](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenvwrapper) installation
2. Environments in the root folder of you project

## Future

The following are all things I'd like to add to atom, but they may not all end
up as part of this tool.

* Updating on system file changes
* Default environments for projects
* More options on environment creation
* pip package manager
* Auto dep tool for setup.py
